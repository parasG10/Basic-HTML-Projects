            <p>C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs circa 1980. C++ is very similar to C (invented by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s). C++ is so much compatible with C that it will probably compile over 99% of C programs without changing a line of source code. Though, C++ is a lot well-structured and safer language than C as it OOPs based. Some computer languages are written for a specific purpose. Like, Java was initially devised to control toasters and some other electronics. C was developed for programming OS. Pascal was conceptualized to teach proper programming techniques. But C++ is a general-purpose language. It well deserves the widely acknowledged nickname "Swiss Pocket Knife of Languages." </p>

            <p>
                <li>Variables are the backbone of any programming language.</li>
                <li>A variable is merely a way to store some information for later use. We can retrieve this value or data by referring to a "word" that will describe this information.</li>
                <li>Once declared and defined they may be used many times within the scope in which they were declared.</li>

                //This is how you can define different variables in C++. <br>
                int x = 5; //Define a integer variable x with value 5. <br>
                string y = "Hi" //Define a string variable y with value Hi. <br>

            <p>You can always change variables after you have defined them.</p>

            <h4>Scope of a variable</h4>

            <p>A scope is a span of a program where a variable has a meaning. Mostly the same name can be used to refer to different entities within different scopes. Variables are visible from the point where they are declared until the end of the scope in which their declaration appears. </p>

            <code>#include <iostream>	
                int main()	<br>
                {	<br>
                    int sum = 0;<br>	
                    // Sum values from 1 through 10 inclusive	<br>
                    for (int val = 1; val <= 10; ++val)	<br>
                        sum += val;  // equivalent to sum = sum + val	<br>
                    cout << "Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is "<< sum <<endl;<br>	
                    return 0;	<br>
                }	</code>

                <p>
                    This program defines 3 names, viz, main, sum, and val. It uses the namespace name std, along with two other names from that namespace—cout and endl. The function name "main" is defined outside the curly braces. The function name main—like most other names defined outside a function—has a global scope. Which means that once declared, names which are at the global scope are accessible throughout the program. The variable sum is defined within the scope of the block which is the body of the main function. It can be accessed from its point of declaration and throughout the rest of the main function's body. However, not outside of it. This means that variable sum has block scope. The variable val is defined in the scope of "for statement". It can easily be used in that statement but not elsewhere in the main function. It has local scope.

        <section class= "main-section" id = "dataTypes">
            <header>Data Types in C++</header>

            <p>
                Data types in C++ is mainly divided into three types: <br><br>

                <h4>Primitive Data Types:</h3> 
                These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char , float, bool etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are:
                   <li>Integer</li>
                   <li>Character</li>
                   <li>Boolean</li>
                   <li>Floating Point</li>
                   <li>Double Floating Point</li>
                   <li>Valueless or Void</li>
                   <li>Wide Character</li><br>

                <h4>Derived Data Types:</h4> 
                The data-types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely:
                    <li>Function</li>
                    <li>Array</li>
                    <li>Pointer</li>
                    <li>Reference</li><br>
                <h4>Abstract or User-Defined Data Types:</h4> 
                These data types are defined by user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:
                    <li>Class</li>
                    <li>Structure</li>
                    <li>Union</li>
                    <li>Enumeration</li>
                    <li>Typedef defined Data Type</li>
                </p>
                
        </section><br>

        <section class= "main-section" id = "ifAndElse">
            <header>if and else statements C++</header>

            <p>The syntax of the if statement is:</p>

            <code>if(boolean_expression) { <br>
                // statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is true <br>
             } else { <br>
               // statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is false <br>
             }</code>

            <p>Here is an example use of both the if and else statements.</p>
            
            <code>#include <iostream> <br>
                using namespace std; <br><br>
                 
                int main () { <br>
                   // local variable declaration: <br>
                   int a = 100; <br><br>
                 
                   // check the boolean condition <br>
                   if( a < 20 ) { <br>
                      // if condition is true then print the following <br>
                      cout << "a is less than 20;" << endl; <br>
                   } else { <br>
                      // if condition is false then print the following <br>
                      cout << "a is not less than 20;" << endl; <br>
                   } <br>
                   cout << "value of a is : " << a << endl; <br><br>
                  
                   return 0; <br>
                }</code>
